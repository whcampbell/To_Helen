quality reduction, so on and so forth. Anyways, I just wanted to 
show you a few things from that sketchbook I mentioned.

The view from a bridge in Paris. This may have been the bridge
on which couples put padlocks, but they had to rebuild it for 
maintenance. The locks were not there anymore. Must be why 
divorce rates are up.

Drawn from the floor of the Lisbon airport right after we found
out that our tickets home had been cancelled for an 
unsatisfying reason. I will never set foot in Lisbon again.
